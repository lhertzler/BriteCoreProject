# BriteCoreProject
You can find the main dashboard screen at http://lukehertzler.com/BriteCore/

This is partially responsive as well.  Wouldn't take much to finish the mobile versions.

I initially tried to fit everything on one page, but ended up going with a drill down design to keep things clean.  A user can select the agency from the initial dashboard and use modal windows to add and manage accounts and agents.  I've included the designs for these in the 'Design' folder.

So, for example, clicking the gear icon under the agency name will bring up 'BriteCore-Project-Single-Agency-Settings-01.png', clicking on a policy type will bring up 'BriteCore-Project-policies-by-state-01.png', clicking a table item under Territory will being up 'BriteCore-Project-Add-State-License-01', and clicking a table item under Agents will bring up 'BriteCore-Project-AddEdit-Agent-01.png'.
